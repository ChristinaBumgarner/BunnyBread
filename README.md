# Website

The primary creator of this website is Christina Bumgarner. I am at North Side High School in Jackson, TN. I had many ideas for this project, but I eventually decided on recreating Bunny Bread's website. I started over from scratch a grand total of 3 times.

I first started by attempting to link all of the files together with links in the actual webpages with W3 CSS navigation bars. I managed to do this, but I scrapped all of it with a business in mind, but the intial business wasn't what I actually ended up creating my site over.

Sept.11,2019- Could not figure out how to make the dropdown hover color white. 

Sept. 12 - I tried to insert a card, but at first the photo was only popping up as a link. I later realized there was a hiccup with the file path, and I got it working as needed. I added margins to the top to separate it from the nav bar because I thought it looked funky.

Sept. 16 - I initially wanted to use Sally Lane's candy farm as my recreation, but I felt there wasn't enough to actually work with as far as media, so I scrapped that idea and probably spent 2 days trying to figure out what website to actually recreate. I settled on Bunny Bread because my dad works for them as a sales manager, so if I had any questions about the actual company, I could ask him.

I started by figuring out what pages I wanted and didn't want. I disagreed with how their official site was organized, I wanted mine to make logical sense, so I worked out several different ways I could organize the Nav bar layout.

I used a CSS file to center the header and logo, because with just HTML and w3CSS, it wouldn't center. I also later added in Bootstrap 4 and a bit of Javascript.

I used a bootstrap carousel with my home page for the scrolling slideshow pictures, because W3CSS only offered a slideshow with one picture at a time, and I preferred 3. I had struggles with getting indicators, it wasn't showing up at all, then they were showing up, but they were white, so I couldn't see them. Then, when I finally got them to be visible and working, they were wonky, and I wasn't happy at all with them. I changed a few lines of code, and now I think they look right at home with the entire feel of the website.

I finished the index/home page pretty quickly, the main struggle was getting the nav bar to behave with the header and logo. The backgrounf color was initially a color with CSS, but I couldn't get it to do exactly what I wanted, so I chose to color the container that held my header, logo to a color with w3css, so that it would match the nav bar. The rest of the page has a white background.

October 15, Homepage is done, excluding fixing the centered privacy policy bar. I want to add in Modal Images to my products page so that I won't have a different page for each of the breads and their nutrition facts, and I can just have a little pop up. It's a lot more code, but I feel that if i can do it right, then it will be much more practical and easier to use.

I still, as of right now, haven't quite figured out the way I want the nav bar. I want to do a few things, but I can't work it out in my own head. 

Nav bar is final, for now. I've completed all pages aside from the recipes page which I can't think of a good layout for, I'll probably mess around with a few ideas when I get home and just test code some stuff, try to figure it out. I also have to do the story pages, which there are 5 of those, but I'm not stressed about those taking a substsantial amount of time to complete. All I plan to do with those is have a Vertical Nav bar for a way to get to the links to the other 4 stories, and have a single slideshow on each page, which I can quickly do with HTML and W3CSS. I'm hoping to have this website finished before the deadline, uploaded, and completely done, last edits and all.
I've finished the products page and the index page now. On the products page, it took me quite a few hours to figure out how to make a w3css modal pop up with another picture and not have the entire wepage mess up. I finally figured it out, and it was because I was going by the completely wrong guide to help me to achieve. A common thing i've noticed in this project is that I tend to overcomplicate very simple things. I feel like I could be a lot farther along with my website than I currently am if I just didn't overthink my supposed-to-be-simple code.

A few days later, and I've only got one page in total to complete. I've got to put in my slideshows for the stories in, and just touch up my recipes page, and I'l be done. From there, it's just making sure everything works, and that everything is fully responsive. I also have to ensure it works on all devices, which partially falls on responsiveness, and partially falls on whether I upload it to GitHub correctly. I'm starting to get excited about seeing my finished product, and adding my last minute fixes, it's like I can finally see the home stretch of something I've poured two months of my life into. My 3 Recipe Pages have turned into a bigger struggle than I thought they would, and I wasn't even going to go with several pages for one subject, when the original website did only 2. But I felt the page looked overly simple and overloaded.

A common theme I'm finding is that I feel that all of my pages are way too simple, but I'm not the best at designing, but with every page that I've struggled with over-simplicity, I eventually come to a happy medium, but the recipes page just isn't getting there, and I can't figure out why. If I can't figure out how to make myself pleased with my result before the help night, I'm certainly going to bring that in as a question.

My recipes pages have bene giving me the most trouble, the images won't act responsive no matter what I try. I'm probably just going to work on getting my website essentially done, and worry about responsiveness later.
